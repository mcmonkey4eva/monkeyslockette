monkey's lockette
-----------------

Lockette remake primarly for my personal use, but made available to all.

Current version is explicitly for 1.13+ (not older versions - for those see previous commits)

Download: [Click Here](https://github.com/mcmonkey4eva/monkeyslockette/raw/master/MonkeysLockette.jar)

Sign options:  
[Everyone]  -> Everyone is allowed  
[Hoppers]   -> Hoppers can steal from this chest or chest-like block  
g:GROUPNAME -> Allows all members of the permission group (requires Vault)  
PLAYERNAME  -> Allows the exact player specified. (Will accept partial names if the user's name is longer than the sign's length limit)  

Permissions:

- monkeyslockette.admin - administrative control (bypass, etc.)
- monkeyslockette.create - general user control (placing signs, etc.)
- monkeyslockette.command - the /lock command

### Warning

This plugin was started when I was not so great at Java or Minecraft stuff and bares some historical troubles from that.

This includes:

- Awkward package structure
- Direct WorldGuard and Vault dependencies
- Ugly code
- Hilarious formatting
- Originally written in *Eclipse*
- The jar is just dumped in the repo instead of hosted off a CI
- I don't even know what else, but more
